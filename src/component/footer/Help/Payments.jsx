            What is Cash on Delivery?
          </h3>
          <p className="fw-normal ">
            If you are not comfortable making an online payment , you can opt
            for the Cash on Delivery (C-o-D) payment method instead. With C-o-D
            you can pay in cash at the time of actual delivery of the product at
            your doorstep, without requiring you to make any advance payment
            online.
          </p>
          <p className="fw-normal ">
            The maximum order value for a Cash on Delivery (C-o-D) payment is
            â‚¹50,000. It is strictly a cash-only payment method. Gift Cards or
            store credit cannot be used for C-o-D orders. Foreign currency
            cannot be used to make a C-o-D payment. Only Indian Rupees accepted.
